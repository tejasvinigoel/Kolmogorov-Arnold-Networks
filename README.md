By the end of this project we would have achieved the following outcomes:

1. A comprehensive understanding of the theoretical foundations, architecture, and real-world ap-
plications of KANs.

2. A critical analysis of the strengths, weaknesses, and potential improvements in the design and
implementation of KANs.
3. Hands-on experience in developing, simulating, and optimizing KANs using libraries such as
Pytorch.

We have achieved the following outcomes:
- Explored a novel neural network design inspired by the Kolmogorov-Arnold Representation Theorem, replacing traditional fixed activation functions with learnable edge functions.
- Designed and implemented CNN-KAN models using the pyKAN library, incorporating advanced B-Spline-based activation functions for improved interpretability and performance.
- Conducted a comprehensive case study applying CNN-KAN on multiple datasets from the MedMNIST suite, including PathMNIST, showcasing the networkâ€™s capability in medical image classification tasks.
- Compared CNN-KAN with Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs), identifying significant improvements in model interpretability with competitive accuracy and parameter efficiency.
- Evaluated model performance using F1-score, AUC-ROC, and Accuracy, demonstrating potential in lightweight and accessible biomedical ML applications.
